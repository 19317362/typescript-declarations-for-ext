This takes JSDuck output (https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) and turns it into type declarations for Typescript.

This is designed to be used in conjunction with fabioparra's patched Typescript compiler that emits ExtJS style classes (https://github.com/fabioparra/TypeScriptExtJSEmitter).

This is really not finished yet, please don't try and use it!
